# Vehicle-State-Estimation-in-Automotive-Electromobility
Implementation of a grey-box recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, which can be used for estimation of key electric vehicle (EV) parameters, such as battery condition and vehicle mass, in real time. The method contains least squares estimation with forgetting factor for faster adaptation to changing conditions
